# Electric-Vehicle-Charge-Demand
Analysis and forecasting of electric vehicle charging demand using real-world data to support efficient infrastructure planning.
This project leverages machine learning techniques to analyze and predict EV charging demand.
By identifying usage patterns and demand trends,it aims to optimize charging station placement and improve grid load management.
The core goals of this project are:

-->To analyze historical EV data and uncover meaningful patterns using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-->To clean and preprocess raw data for machine learning modeling

-->To compare the performance of multiple regression models (including Random Forest, XGBoost, SVR, etc.)

-->To identify the best model for forecasting EV population size based on evaluation metrics

-->To save the final model for future use or deployment
